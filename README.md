## Project Overview

Project Title: PricePoint: A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Housing Prices with Feature-Rich Regression Models

Develop and evaluate regression models to predict the sale price of houses using features such as location, size, and year built. The goal is to assess which models generalize best and to interpret which features most influence housing value.

This project demonstrates my ability to apply regression modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. I will load:

- Load and explore a dataset.
- Choose and justify features for predicting a target variable.
- Train a regression model and evaluate performance.
- Compare multiple regression approaches.
- Document your work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.
- Conduct a peer review of a classmate's project.

## Dataset Used

🥇 🏡 Housing Prices Dataset

Housing Prices Dataset (Predict home values based on features like square footage and location)

- [Kaggle Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

Why: It provides the richest feature set, requires robust preprocessing, and allows you to explore regularization, ensembling, and interpretability. It mirrors the messiness and opportunities you'd face in real-world applied machine learning.

## Project Findings

Please refer to the detailed [Reflections.md](reflections.md) for section-based insights, observations, and reflections captured throughout the modeling process.

## Final Overview: The Full Data Flow

### Assignment Requirements

1. Create a GitHub repository named **ml_regression_yourname**.  
2. Upload your dataset to a **data folder** in the repository.  
3. Develop a Jupyter Notebook (regression_yourname.ipynb) structured as outlined above.  
4. Complete and write reflections for each section as you work.
5. Write a **README.md** summarizing your project, dataset, and findings (see below).
6. Review a classmate’s project and provide feedback in peer_review.md (see below).

---

### Peer Review (Required)

Review one other GitHub repository and provide feedback on:

1. Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
1. Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
1. Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
1. Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)

**Submission**: Submit a short peer review document in your own repository titled peer_review.md.  
The peer review must contain a **clickable Markdown link to the notebook (.ipynb) file reviewed** along with your personal, well-organized and presented 4-pont review.
Provide specifics - both positive and constructive feedback.
Suggest improvements where possible and explain why a different choice might be useful as well.
Focus on actionable suggestions that the author could realistically implement.
