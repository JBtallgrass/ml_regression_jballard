## Project Overview

Project Title:
This project demonstrates my ability to apply regression modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. I will load:

- Load and explore a dataset.
- Choose and justify features for predicting a target variable.
- Train a regression model and evaluate performance.
- Compare multiple regression approaches.
- Document your work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.
- Conduct a peer review of a classmate's project.

## Final Overview: The Full Data Flow

### Assignment Requirements

1. Create a GitHub repository named **ml_regression_yourname**.  
2. Upload your dataset to a **data folder** in the repository.  
3. Develop a Jupyter Notebook (regression_yourname.ipynb) structured as outlined above.  
4. Complete and write reflections for each section as you work.
5. Write a **README.md** summarizing your project, dataset, and findings (see below).
6. Review a classmate’s project and provide feedback in peer_review.md (see below).

---

### Peer Review (Required)

Review one other GitHub repository and provide feedback on:

1. Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
1. Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
1. Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
1. Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)

**Submission**: Submit a short peer review document in your own repository titled peer_review.md.  
The peer review must contain a **clickable Markdown link to the notebook (.ipynb) file reviewed** along with your personal, well-organized and presented 4-pont review.
Provide specifics - both positive and constructive feedback.
Suggest improvements where possible and explain why a different choice might be useful as well.
Focus on actionable suggestions that the author could realistically implement.
