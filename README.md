## Project Overview

Project Title: PricePoint: A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Housing Prices with Feature-Rich Regression Models

Develop and evaluate regression models to predict the sale price of houses using features such as location, size, and year built. The goal is to assess which models generalize best and to interpret which features most influence housing value.

This project demonstrates my ability to apply regression modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. I will load:

- Load and explore a dataset.
- Choose and justify features for predicting a target variable.
- Train a regression model and evaluate performance.
- Compare multiple regression approaches.
- Document your work in a structured Jupyter Notebook.
- Conduct a peer review of a classmate's project.

## Dataset Used

🥇 🏡 Housing Prices Dataset

Housing Prices Dataset (Predict home values based on features like square footage and location)

- [Kaggle Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

Why: It provides the richest feature set, requires robust preprocessing, and allows you to explore regularization, ensembling, and interpretability. It mirrors the messiness and opportunities you'd face in real-world applied machine learning.

## Project Findings

Please refer to the detailed [Reflections.md](reflections.md) for section-based insights, observations, and reflections captured throughout the modeling process.
