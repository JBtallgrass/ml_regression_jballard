## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to apply regression modeling techniques to a real-world dataset. Tasks included:

- Loading and exploring a dataset.
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Comparing manual, pipeline, and polynomial regression.
- Hosting results with GitHub Pages.

## Dataset Used

Medical Costs Dataset (Predict insurance charges based on age, BMI, smoking status)
![Medical Cost Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)

Medical cost dataset containing personal and lifestyle variables like age, BMI, children, smoker status, and region.

## Project Findings

Please refer to the detailed [Reflections.md](reflections.md) file for full insights.

### Reflections Summary

This project pushed me to move beyond basic model-building and explore how thoughtful preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation shape the outcome. I refined the data through clipping, scaling, and feature creation (`bmi_smoker`)â€”and saw real gains in performance. Pipeline 2 (Polynomial Regression) proved most effective.

The side quest of hosting an interactive chart via GitHub Pages taught me how to share results in a more accessible, visual way. For me, machine learning is about experimentation, iteration, and clarityâ€”and this project brought all of that together.
