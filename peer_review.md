## GitHub Repository Review

**Project:** *Predicting Medical Insurance Charges with Regression Analysis*  
**Author:** Mhamed

## **Clarity & Organization**

The notebook is well-structured and easy to follow. Each section is clearly labeled with consistent formatting that guides the reader through the full machine learning workflow. Code blocks are cleanly separated from explanatory text, and the use of inline reflections adds helpful context throughout. One minor suggestion: remove unused classifier imports early in the notebook to reduce clutter and avoid confusion about model intent.

## **Feature Selection & Justification**

Feature selection is appropriate and well-justified. The decision to include all available variables‚Äîparticularly age, BMI, and smoker status‚Äîaligns well with the goal of predicting insurance charges. The correlation heatmap further supports these choices. While feature selection was not overly engineered, the rationale was clearly stated and rooted in domain relevance.

## **Model Performance & Comparisons**

Model results are clearly presented, with thoughtful evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤ metrics. Comparing the baseline linear regression model to two pipeline approaches (including a polynomial regression) adds depth. The use of pipelines demonstrates strong understanding of model scaling and preprocessing. A quick summary table of all performance metrics at the end was a great addition. Including feature importance or cross-validation would further strengthen the analysis.

## **Reflection Quality**

Reflections throughout the notebook are thoughtful and insightful. Mhamed identifies challenges like outliers and explains choices (e.g., keeping them to preserve real-world patterns). The final section is particularly strong, with clear articulation of lessons learned and next steps. These reflections enhance both technical and strategic understanding, showing maturity in analysis.

Overall, this was a solid, well-executed project that blends technical skills with meaningful interpretation. Great job!
